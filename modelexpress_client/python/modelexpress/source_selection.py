"""Client-side P2P source selection.

Ranks the compatible READY source workers returned by the metadata backend
before transfer attempts. The flow is:

    metadata backend -> ListSources(identity, READY) -> filter by worker_rank
      -> SourceSelector.order(candidates, ctx) -> slice to MAX_SOURCE_RETRIES
      -> NIXL/RDMA transfer

Selectors order candidates using the live ``LoadContext`` (the same object the
load strategies already pass around): only a few fields are read
(``worker_rank``, ``worker_id``, ``identity.model_name``), so there is no
parallel context type to keep in sync. The annotation is a forward reference to
avoid importing the load_strategy package at module load.

Phase 1 is stateless: a policy ranks candidates using only the current
candidate list, the target context, and the configured policy. It keeps no
global counters, leases, or server-side state. ``random`` preserves today's
behavior and stays the fallback whenever a non-random policy is misconfigured
or fails to construct.

    ``score = unit_hash(target, candidate) - w_load * source_load``

    ``source_load`` is a source-published estimate in ``[0, 1]`` of how busy
    that source is, measured by the source about itself and surfaced on the
    candidate. The default provider reads the source's RDMA NIC utilization
    (from its own port counters); a runtime provider (e.g. vLLM/SGLang serving
    load) can supply it instead behind the same field. Subtracting it steers
    new targets toward sources with spare headroom, so pulling weights does not
    contend with a source's in-flight inference (e.g. a prefill node streaming
    KV cache). ``w_load`` comes from ``MX_P2P_LOAD_WEIGHT`` (default 1.0).

    Statelessness is preserved: the load signal is self-described source
    metadata read off each candidate, not a server-side counter -- so every
    replica ranks identically and MX servers stay stateless behind a load
    balancer. A measured load of 0 carries no penalty, so a fleet of idle
    sources orders exactly as ``rendezvous_hash``. A candidate that published
    no load at all is different: it scores as ``UNKNOWN_LOAD_PRIOR`` rather
    than as idle, so in a mixed fleet the sources whose load is invisible
    (older clients, providers with no signal) neither outrank nor trail the

    ``score = (shared_depth, tiebreak)``. ``shared_depth`` is the index of the
    narrowest topology level (broad -> narrow) at which the target and the
    candidate share a domain value; ``order()`` sorts by descending score, so the
    closest source wins and the tiebreak only decides among equidistant peers.
    Because MX P2P is NIXL over RDMA between replicas on different nodes, the
    relevant locality is the inter-node RDMA fabric -- same rack (one leaf hop)
    -> same block (spine group) -> same datacenter -> cross-datacenter. The level
    hierarchy is not hard-coded: it comes from ``MX_P2P_TOPOLOGY_LEVELS``, the
    ordered Grove ``ClusterTopology`` (``clustertopologies.grove.io``)
    ``spec.levels`` domains, and the per-source values from each candidate's
    published ``topology`` metadata -- so MX consumes the same node-label
    topology Grove/Dynamo already define rather than inventing its own.

    The ``tiebreak`` is the rendezvous jitter, so peers in the same tier still
    spread instead of piling onto the one nearest source. When no levels are
    configured, this node has no topology, or nothing is shared, ``shared_depth``
    is constant and ordering collapses exactly to that jitter (rendezvous order)
    -- never worse than the deterministic baseline. NVLink is intentionally not
    modeled: co-located source/target replicas let NIXL auto-select the NVLink
    backend, so the selector need not.

    Composes with load-aware selection without depending on it: when the
    within-tier load weight is > 0 the tiebreak becomes ``unit_hash - w *
    source_load`` (``source_load`` read defensively off the candidate), so within
    a locality tier it also steers away from busy sources. The weight is
    ``MX_P2P_TOPOLOGY_LOAD_WEIGHT`` when set, else it falls back to the load_aware
    weight ``MX_P2P_LOAD_WEIGHT`` when that feature is deployed -- so a single
    knob turns both on together. With the weight at 0 (default) the tiebreak is
    the pure jitter and the selector needs nothing from the load-aware feature.
