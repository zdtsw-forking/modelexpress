"""Metadata prefetch for workers without shared model storage.

An engine needs a resolvable local snapshot long before it loads weights:
vLLM calls ``snapshot_download`` while parsing engine args, and the tokenizer
follows right after. Neither can wait for the weight loader, and neither is
served by P2P, which transfers GPU tensors and never repository files.

So the two halves are fetched at different times. Everything except the
weights is pulled here, unconditionally, before the engine resolves the model.
The weights stay with the strategy chain, where P2P keeps first refusal and
:mod:`modelexpress.load_strategy.server_cache_strategy` only steps in on a
miss. Fetching metadata early costs one small transfer and does not weaken
P2P-first, because no weight ever moves on this path.

This module also remembers which repo id produced which snapshot directory.
vLLM rewrites ``ModelConfig.model`` in place with the resolved local path, so
by the time a strategy runs, the repo id the server needs is gone unless
something recorded it.
