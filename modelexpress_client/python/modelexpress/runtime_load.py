"""Inference-runtime serving load as a ``source_load`` signal (vLLM / SGLang).

The MX client runs inside the inference worker's pod, so it can scrape the
worker's own Prometheus ``/metrics`` and turn a serving-load proxy into a
``[0, 1]`` ``source_load``. This complements the physical NIC-utilization
provider (`nic_metrics.py`): the runtime signal is *predictive* -- a full KV
cache or a deep prefill queue foretells RDMA the NIC counter has not seen yet --
and it works on fabrics the sysfs counters cannot read.

It reads whichever known load metric is present, so the same provider covers
vLLM and SGLang without configuration beyond the endpoint URL
(``MX_P2P_RUNTIME_METRICS_URL``). Everything is best-effort: an unreachable
endpoint or an unrecognized exposition yields ``0.0``, so the blend falls back
to the NIC signal (and ultimately to ``rendezvous_hash``).
