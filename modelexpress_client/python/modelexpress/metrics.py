"""Opt-in Prometheus metrics for the ModelExpress client.

Disabled by default; enable with ``MX_METRICS_ENABLED=1``. The client is a
library inside someone else's engine process, so it stays opt-in — server
metrics default on, these do not.

Two properties are load-bearing and must survive any change here:

* **Recording never raises into the load path.** Every public recorder swallows
  everything. A metrics failure degrades to no metrics, never to a failed model
  load.
* **Structured logs remain the source of truth.** Disabling metrics loses
  comparability, not correctness.

Exposition is one endpoint per **pod**, not per rank. A ModelExpress pod runs one
worker process per GPU, so this module uses ``prometheus_client`` multiprocess
mode: each rank mmaps per-PID files into a pod-local directory, and one process
binds the port and serves the ``MultiProcessCollector`` union of every rank,
including ranks that have already exited. Losing the bind is the *normal* case
rather than a failure, and mmap writes are durable at increment time, so no exit
hook is in the pull path.

``docs/METRICS.md`` carries the operator-facing half: the deployment shape
(memory-backed ``emptyDir``, the two pod-manifest environment variables, the
entrypoint ``--reset``), the four failure modes this replaced, and the
scrape-cost and shared-directory trade-offs. Every rule that fails *silently*
when broken is also stated at the code site that depends on it — those comments
are the point, not decoration.

#: This is the one label on the load families whose domain is NOT a closed enum,

#: bounded by code -- an unrecognized engine clamps to ``other``, an unknown
#: phase is dropped. A model id is whatever the deployment chose to serve, so
#: this label is bounded by *convention*: an organization runs a finite catalogue
#: of models, and that set changes on the timescale of deployments rather than
#: of requests.
#:
#: It costs nothing in practice. A process serves exactly one model, so the label
#: is constant within a pod, and Prometheus already attaches ``pod`` to every
