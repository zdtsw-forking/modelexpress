K8s-Service-routed metadata client.

Duck-typed replacement for :class:`MxClient` that skips the central
coordinator entirely. Each source pool sits behind a Kubernetes Service;
peers open a gRPC channel directly to the Service DNS name and call
``GetTensorManifest``. Kube-proxy load-balances across the ready
backends.

The ``MX_K8S_SERVICE_PATTERN`` pattern decides how rank is encoded:

- **Pattern with explicit port** (e.g. ``mx-sources-rank-{rank}:6555``):
  used verbatim after ``{rank}`` substitution. Rank is encoded in the
  hostname; caller hits one Service per rank, each with a label
  selector that scopes to pods holding that rank. Fits the
  1-GPU-per-pod topology.
- **Pattern without a port** (e.g. ``mx-sources``): client auto-appends
  ``:{MX_WORKER_GRPC_PORT + rank}``. Rank is encoded in the port;
  caller hits one Service with N named ports, each targeting the
  matching in-pod port. Fits the multi-GPU-per-pod topology where every
  pod has every rank.

Rank-matching is enforced two ways regardless of shape:

1. Shape 1: the Service selector scopes the backend pool to pods with
   the right ``mx.rank`` label. Shape 2: the port differentiation
   naturally picks the right rank-R WorkerGrpcServer inside the pod.
2. ``GetTensorManifest`` validates ``mx_source_id`` server-side and the
   client validates the response's ``mx_source_id`` and ``worker_rank``
   before accepting. Mismatches return ``FAILED_PRECONDITION`` (or
   raise on the client side), and the client retries on a fresh
   channel so kube-proxy re-picks a backend.

There is no substrate advertisement here: the Service's Endpoints
object is the source list, maintained by K8s based on pod readiness.
