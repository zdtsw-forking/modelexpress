"""Tests for the opt-in ModelExpress metrics collector.

Two groups. The first locks the guarantees the module has always promised:
every recording call is a no-op when metrics are disabled, and nothing ever
raises into the load path.

The second is a regression test per defect in the exposition path. Each one
fails against the previous implementation, which is the point — every defect
produced plausible-looking but wrong output rather than an error, so only a test
that asserts the *corrected* shape can tell them apart:

* **D2** one rank bound the port and N-1 gave up, so the endpoint served one
  rank's data while presenting as the pod's.
* **D3** the Pushgateway grouping key was the hostname, and the push is a PUT
  that replaces the whole group, so ranks on a host erased each other.
* **D4** initialization was reachable only from a recording call, so a run that
  skipped P2P produced output byte-identical to ``MX_METRICS_ENABLED=0``.
* **D6** the push ran from ``atexit``, which does not run on SIGKILL.
* **D7** ``source_worker_id`` was a per-process uuid, so its label domain grew
  without bound.
* **D8** ``mx_p2p_candidates{stage="listed"}`` could never observe zero, and a
  ListSources RPC failure recorded nothing at all.

D1 (the Helm annotation pointed at the gRPC port) is a deployment artifact,
covered by ``test_metrics_deployment.py`` and by the server integration test in
``modelexpress_server/tests/in_process_server.rs``.
